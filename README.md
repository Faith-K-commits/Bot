# Bot Battlr

Welcome to Bot Battlr, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army! This web app allows users to browse a collection of bots, view detailed information, and enlist them into a personal army. You can manage your army by adding bots, releasing them, or discharging them forever.

# Features

As a user, you can:

- View All Bots: See profiles of all bots rendered in the BotCollection component.

- Enlist Bots: Add an individual bot to your army by clicking on it. The selected bot will render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot will still be visible in the BotCollection.

- Release Bots: Release a bot from your army by clicking on it. The bot will disappear from the YourBotArmy component.

- Discharge Bots: Permanently discharge a bot from service by clicking the red "x" button. This action will delete the bot from both the backend and the YourBotArmy component.
